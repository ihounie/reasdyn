This year, the company plans to invest $155815.17 in new machinery, while also experiencing asset depreciation of $65374.28. How will the company's Asset Turnover Ratio change after accounting for the new investment and depreciation?",
    "original_answer": "Step 1: Calculate the current Asset Turnover Ratio:\n  Old Asset Turnover Ratio = $1983101.0 / $1338762.08 = 1.48\n\nStep 2: Adjust total assets for new investment and depreciation:\n  Adjusted Assets = $1338762.08 + $155815.17 - $65374.28 = $1429202.97\n\nStep 3: Calculate Asset Turnover Ratio after adjustments:\n  New Asset Turnover Ratio = $1983101.0 / $1429202.97 = 1.39\n\nStep 4: Calculate the change in Asset Turnover Ratio:\n  Change in Asset Turnover Ratio = 1.39 - 1.48 = -0.09",
