    "qwen_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how the company's Asset Turnover Ratio will change after the new investment and depreciation. Hmm, first, I need to remember what the Asset Turnover Ratio is. From what I recall, it's calculated by dividing the total sales by the total assets. So, the formula is:\n\nAsset Turnover Ratio = Total Sales / Total Assets\n\nRight? So, the question is asking how this ratio will change after the company invests in new machinery and experiences depreciation. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nCompany A has total sales of $1,983,101.00 and total assets of $1,338,762.08. This year, they plan to invest $155,815.17 in new machinery, and there's asset depreciation of $65,374.28. \n\nWait, so the investment in new machinery would increase the total assets, right? Because they're buying new machinery. But depreciation is the reduction in value of existing assets over time. So, depreciation would decrease the total assets. Therefore, the net change in total assets would be the investment minus depreciation? Or is it the other way around?\n\nLet me think. When a company invests in new machinery, that's an addition to total assets. Depreciation is an expense that reduces the value of existing assets. So, the total assets would be the original assets plus the new investment, minus the depreciation. So, the new total assets would be:\n\nOriginal Assets + New Investment - Depreciation\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nOriginal Assets = $1,338,762.08\n\nNew Investment = $155,815.17\n\nDepreciation = $65,374.28\n\nSo, new total assets = 1,338,762.08 + 155,815.17 - 65,374.28\n\nLet me calculate that. First, add the new investment to original assets:\n\n1,338,762.08 + 155,815.17 = Let's do 1,338,762.08 + 155,815.17. \n\nAdding the whole numbers first: 1,338,762 + 155,815 = 1,494,577. Then the decimals: 0.08 + 0.17 = 0.25. So total is 1,494,577.25. \n\nThen subtract depreciation: 1,494,577.25 - 65,374.28. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, 1,494,577.25 - 65,374.28. Let me subtract 65,000 first: 1,494,577.25 - 65,000 = 1,429,577.25. Then subtract the remaining 374.28: 1,429,577.25 - 374.28 = 1,429,202.97. \n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I should do it step by step. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me write down:\n\nOriginal Assets: 1,338,762.08\n\nPlus new investment: 155,815.17\n\nTotal before depreciation: 1,338,762.08 + 155,815.17 = 1,494,577.25\n\nThen subtract depreciation: 65,374.28\n\nSo, 1,494,577.25 - 65,374.28 = ?\n\nLet me subtract 65,374.28 from 1,494,577.25.\n\nLet me think of it as:\n\n1,494,577.25 - 65,374.28\n\nFirst, subtract 65,000 from 1,494,577.25: 1,494,577.25 - 65,000 = 1,429,577.25\n\nThen subtract the remaining 374.28: 1,429,577.25 - 374.28 = 1,429,202.97\n\nYes, so the new total assets are $1,429,202.97.\n\nWait, but let me check with another way. Maybe using calculator steps:\n\nOriginal assets: 1,338,762.08\n\nAdd 155,815.17: 1,338,762.08 + 155,815.17 = 1,494,577.25 (as before)\n\nSubtract 65,374.28: 1,494,577.25 - 65,374.28\n\nLet me subtract 65,374.28 from 1,494,577.25:\n\nLet me write 1,494,577.25 - 65,374.28.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n.25 - .28. Since 0.25 is less than 0.28, I need to borrow 1 from the dollar part. So, 1.25 - 0.28 = 0.97. But since we borrowed 1, the dollar part becomes 1,494,577 - 1 = 1,494,576, and then subtract 65,374.28? Wait, maybe I'm complicating.\n\nAlternatively, think of 1,494,577.25 - 65,374.28 = ?\n\nLet me subtract 65,374.28 from 1,494,577.25:\n\nFirst, 1,494,577.25 - 65,374.28 = ?\n\nLet me convert them to cents to avoid decimals, but that might be too tedious. Alternatively, subtract step by step.\n\nLet me subtract 65,374 from 1,494,577.25 first, then subtract the remaining 0.28.\n\nSo, 1,494,577.25 - 65,374 = ?\n\n1,494,577.25 - 65,374 = 1,494,577.25 - 65,374.00 = ?\n\nLet me compute 1,494,577.25 - 65,374.00:\n\nSubtract 65,000 from 1,494,577.25: 1,494,577.25 - 65,000 = 1,429,577.25\n\nThen subtract 374: 1,429,577.25 - 374 = 1,429,203.25\n\nThen subtract the 0.28: 1,429,203.25 - 0.28 = 1,429,202.97\n\nYes, so that's $1,429,202.97. Okay, so the new total assets are $1,429,202.97.\n\nNow, the original Asset Turnover Ratio was Sales / Total Assets. Let me compute that first, then compute the new ratio after the changes.\n\nOriginal Sales = $1,983,101.00\n\nOriginal Total Assets = $1,338,762.08\n\nOriginal Asset Turnover Ratio = 1,983,101 / 1,338,762.08\n\nLet me compute that. Let me approximate first. Let's see, 1,338,762.08 times 1.5 is 2,008,143.12. The sales are 1,983,101, which is a bit less than 1.5 times. So the ratio is slightly less than 1.5. Let me calculate it more accurately.\n\nDivide 1,983,101 by 1,338,762.08.\n\nLet me do this division. Let me use a calculator approach.\n\nFirst, let me note that 1,338,762.08 * 1.48 = ?\n\nBut maybe it's easier to just do 1,983,101 / 1,338,762.08 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute 1,983,101 \u00f7 1,338,762.08.\n\nWell, 1,338,762.08 * 1.48 = ?\n\nWell, 1,338,762.08 * 1.4 = 1,338,762.08 * 1 + 1,338,762.08 * 0.4 = 1,338,762.08 + 535,504.83 = 1,874,266.91\n\nThen 1,338,762.08 * 0.08 = 107,100.97\n\nSo total 1.48 times is 1,874,266.91 + 107,100.97 = 1,981,367.88\n\nWhich is very close to 1,983,101. So the original ratio is approximately 1.48 + (1,983,101 - 1,981,367.88)/1,338,762.08\n\nDifference is 1,983,101 - 1,981,367.88 = 1,733.12\n\nSo 1,733.12 / 1,338,762.08 \u2248 0.001293\n\nSo total ratio \u2248 1.48 + 0.001293 \u2248 1.4813\n\nSo approximately 1.4813. Let me check with a calculator for more precision, but since I can't do that, maybe I can accept that for now.\n\nNow, the new Asset Turnover Ratio would be Sales / New Total Assets.\n\nSales remain the same? Wait, the problem says \"This year, the company plans to invest... while also experiencing asset depreciation.\" It doesn't mention any change in sales. So the sales are still $1,983,101.00. Therefore, the new ratio is 1,983,101 / 1,429,202.97.\n\nLet me compute that. Again, let's approximate.\n\nFirst, note that 1,429,202.97 * 1.38 = ?\n\nLet me compute 1,429,202.97 * 1.3 = 1,857,963.86\n\n1,429,202.97 * 0.08 = 114,336.24\n\nSo total 1.38 is 1,857,963.86 + 114,336.24 = 1,972,300.10\n\nCompare that to sales of 1,983,101. So the ratio is 1.38 + (1,983,101 - 1,972,300.10)/1,429,202.97\n\nDifference is 1,983,101 - 1,972,300.10 = 10,800.90\n\nSo 10,800.90 / 1,429,202.97 \u2248 0.00756\n\nTherefore, the new ratio is approximately 1.38 + 0.00756 \u2248 1.3876\n\nSo approximately 1.3876. \n\nTherefore, the original ratio was approximately 1.4813, and the new ratio is approximately 1.3876. \n\nTherefore, the Asset Turnover Ratio decreased from approximately 1.48 to approximately 1.39, so it decreased. \n\nBut let me check if my approximations are correct. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the exact numbers.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the exact original ratio and the new ratio.\n\nOriginal ratio: 1,983,101 / 1,338,762.08\n\nLet me compute this division more accurately. Let me write it as:\n\nDividend: 1,983,101\n\nDivisor: 1,338,762.08\n\nLet me compute 1,983,101 \u00f7 1,338,762.08\n\nLet me use decimal division. Let me consider that 1,338,762.08 * x = 1,983,101\n\nSo x = 1,983,101 / 1,338,762.08 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute this using fractions. Let me convert both numbers to cents to eliminate decimals? Maybe not necessary. Alternatively, approximate decimal.\n\nLet me note that 1,338,762.08 * 1.48 = 1,981,367.88 as before, which is 1,981,367.88\n\nDifference between 1,983,101 and 1,981,367.88 is 1,733.12\n\nSo, 1,733.12 / 1,338,762.08 \u2248 0.001293\n\nSo total ratio is 1.48 + 0.001293 \u2248 1.481293, so approximately 1.4813\n\nSimilarly, new ratio is 1,983,101 / 1,429,202.97\n\nLet me compute that. Let me note that 1,429,202.97 * 1.38 = 1,972,300.10 as before. Difference between 1,983,101 and 1,972,300.10 is 10,800.90\n\nSo, 10,800.90 / 1,429,202.97 \u2248 0.00756\n\nSo total ratio is 1.38 + 0.00756 \u2248 1.38756, so approximately 1.3876\n\nTherefore, the original ratio was ~1.4813 and the new ratio is ~1.3876. Therefore, the ratio decreased by approximately 1.4813 - 1.3876 = 0.0937. So roughly a 9.37% decrease? Wait, but the question is asking how the ratio will change, so maybe we need to compute the exact value or present the exact numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the exact numbers with more precision.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use exact fractions.\n\nBut perhaps the question expects us to compute the exact value. Let me try to compute the exact original ratio and new ratio.\n\nOriginal ratio: 1,983,101 / 1,338,762.08\n\nLet me compute this division using decimal division.\n\nFirst, let me note that 1,338,762.08 \u00d7 1.48 = 1,981,367.88 as before.\n\nSo 1,983,101 - 1,981,367.88 = 1,733.12\n\nSo 1,733.12 / 1,338,762.08 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 100: 17.3312 / 13,387.6208 \u2248 0.001293\n\nSo, the original ratio is approximately 1.48 + 0.001293 \u2248 1.481293\n\nSimilarly, new ratio: 1,983,101 / 1,429,202.97\n\nLet me compute 1,429,202.97 \u00d7 1.38 = 1,972,300.10 as before.\n\nDifference is 1,983,101 - 1,972,300.10 = 10,800.90\n\nSo, 10,800.90"

    "qwen_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how these changes will affect Company E's Debt-to-Equity ratio. First, I need to recall what the Debt-to-Equity ratio is. From what I remember, it's a financial metric that compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholders' equity. The formula is Total Liabilities divided by Shareholders' Equity. So, Debt-to-Equity = Total Liabilities / Shareholders' Equity. \n\nAlright, the company currently has total liabilities of $672,394.01 and shareholders' equity of $112,713.07. Let me write that down:\n\nCurrent Total Liabilities (TL) = $672,394.01  \nCurrent Shareholders' Equity (SE) = $112,713.07  \nCurrent Debt-to-Equity (D/E) ratio = TL / SE = 672,394.01 / 112,713.07\n\nLet me calculate that. Let me get my calculator out. Dividing 672,394.01 by 112,713.07... Hmm, let me approximate. Let's see, 112,713.07 times 5 is 563,565.35. That's less than 672,394.01. Then 112,713.07 times 6 is 676,278.42. Oh, that's a bit more than 672,394.01. So the ratio is a little less than 6. Let me compute it more accurately. \n\nLet me do 672,394.01 divided by 112,713.07. Let me do this division step by step. \n\nFirst, 112,713.07 * 5 = 563,565.35  \nSubtract that from 672,394.01: 672,394.01 - 563,565.35 = 108,828.66  \nNow, 112,713.07 * 0.96 is approximately 112,713.07 * 1 = 112,713.07 minus 112,713.07 * 0.04 = 4,508.52. So 112,713.07 - 4,508.52 = 108,204.55. \n\nSo 0.96 times 112,713.07 is approximately 108,204.55. The remaining amount after 5.96 is 108,828.66 - 108,204.55 = 624.11. So that's about 0.0055. So total ratio is approximately 5.96 + 0.0055 \u2248 5.9655. So roughly 5.97. Let me check with calculator steps. Alternatively, maybe I can just compute it directly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can just accept that the current D/E is approximately 5.97. But maybe I should do exact calculation. Let me try again. \n\nLet me write it as 672,394.01 / 112,713.07. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 100 to make it simpler: 6723.9401 / 1127.1307. Let me approximate. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 6.7239401 / 1.1271307. Let me compute this division. \n\nSo, 1.1271307 * 5 = 5.6356535  \nSubtract that from 6.7239401: 6.7239401 - 5.6356535 = 1.0882866  \nNow, 1.1271307 * 0.96 = 1.0819954  \nSubtract that from 1.0882866: 1.0882866 - 1.0819954 = 0.0062912  \nSo, total is 5.96 + (0.0062912 / 1.1271307). Let me compute that fraction: 0.0062912 / 1.1271307 \u2248 0.00558. So total ratio is approximately 5.96 + 0.00558 \u2248 5.9656. So approximately 5.97. So the current D/E ratio is about 5.97. \n\nNow, the company repays $64,054.29 of its long-term debt and borrows an additional $108,165.22 in short-term loans. I need to figure out how these transactions affect the total liabilities and shareholders' equity, and then recalculate the D/E ratio. \n\nFirst, let's recall that repaying a long-term debt reduces total liabilities. Borrowing short-term loans increases total liabilities. Shareholders' equity is not directly affected by these transactions, right? Because repaying debt is a liability reduction, and borrowing is a liability increase. So shareholders' equity remains the same unless there's some other effect, like if the company issues equity or repurchases shares, but the problem doesn't mention that. \n\nSo, first, let me compute the new total liabilities. \n\nOriginal total liabilities: $672,394.01  \nRepay long-term debt: -$64,054.29  \nBorrow short-term loans: +$108,165.22  \nSo, new total liabilities = 672,394.01 - 64,054.29 + 108,165.22\n\nLet me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, subtract 64,054.29 from 672,394.01. \n\n672,394.01 - 64,054.29 = ?\n\nLet me compute 672,394.01 - 64,000 = 608,394.01  \nThen subtract the remaining 54.29: 608,394.01 - 54.29 = 608,339.72\n\nThen add 108,165.22 to that:\n\n608,339.72 + 108,165.22 = ?\n\nLet me add 608,339.72 + 100,000 = 708,339.72  \nThen add 8,165.22: 708,339.72 + 8,165.22 = 716,504.94\n\nSo the new total liabilities are $716,504.94\n\nWait, that seems counterintuitive. Wait, the company repaid some long-term debt, which would decrease liabilities, but then borrowed short-term loans, which increases liabilities. So the net effect is that the total liabilities went up by (108,165.22 - 64,054.29) = 44,110.93. Let me check:\n\nOriginal liabilities: 672,394.01  \nChange: -64,054.29 + 108,165.22 = +44,110.93  \nNew liabilities: 672,394.01 + 44,110.93 = 716,504.94. Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo total liabilities increased by $44,110.93. \n\nNow, shareholders' equity remains the same, right? Because the company is just repaying debt and taking on new debt. So SE is still $112,713.07. \n\nTherefore, the new D/E ratio is 716,504.94 / 112,713.07. Let me compute that. \n\nEarlier, the original D/E was about 5.97. Let me see how this new value compares. \n\nFirst, let me compute 716,504.94 divided by 112,713.07. \n\nAgain, let me do this division. Let me approximate. \n\nLet me note that 112,713.07 * 6 = 676,278.42  \nBut the new total liabilities is 716,504.94, which is higher than 676,278.42. \n\nSo the ratio is 6 plus (716,504.94 - 676,278.42)/112,713.07. \n\nCompute the difference: 716,504.94 - 676,278.42 = 40,226.52\n\nSo, 40,226.52 / 112,713.07 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 40.22652 / 112.71307 \u2248 0.357. \n\nTherefore, the new D/E ratio is approximately 6 + 0.357 = 6.357. \n\nSo approximately 6.36. \n\nWait, but let me check with more precise calculation. \n\nAlternatively, let me do 716,504.94 / 112,713.07. \n\nLet me use the previous method. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 1000 again: 716.50494 / 112.71307. \n\nLet me approximate 716.50494 \u00f7 112.71307. \n\nFirst, 112.71307 * 6 = 676.27842  \nSubtract that from 716.50494: 716.50494 - 676.27842 = 40.22652  \nNow, 40.22652 / 112.71307 \u2248 0.357 (as before). \n\nSo total is 6.357. So approximately 6.36. \n\nSo the original D/E ratio was approximately 5.97, and after the changes, it's approximately 6.36. \n\nTherefore, the Debt-to-Equity ratio has increased. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. \n\nOriginal total liabilities: $672,394.01  \nRepay long-term debt: -$64,054.29  \nBorrow short-term: +$108,165.22  \nTotal change in liabilities: -64,054.29 + 108,165.22 = +44,110.93  \nNew total liabilities: 672,394.01 + 44,110.93 = 716,504.94. Correct. \n\nShareholders' equity remains the same: $112,713.07. \n\nTherefore, new D/E ratio is 716,504.94 / 112,713.07 \u2248 6.36. \n\nOriginal D/E was 672,394.01 / 112,713.07 \u2248 5.97. \n\nSo the ratio increased from ~5.97 to ~6.36. \n\nTherefore, the Debt-to-Equity ratio increased. \n\nBut let me check if there's any other factors. For example, is the Debt-to-Equity ratio calculated using total liabilities or just long-term liabilities? Wait, the standard Debt-to-Equity ratio uses total liabilities, which includes both long-term and short-term. So when the company repays long-term debt and takes on short-term debt, total liabilities go up, so the D/E ratio increases. \n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use only long-term debt for the debt ratio, but the question says \"Debt-to-Equity ratio,\" which typically is total liabilities over equity. \n\nSo, the answer is that the Debt-to-Equity ratio increases. \n\nBut let me check the exact numbers again. Maybe my approximations are leading me astray. Let me compute the exact value of the original D/E ratio and the new one. \n\nOriginal D/E: 672,394.01 / 112,713.07. Let me compute this with more precision. \n\nLet me use decimal division. Let me write 672394.01 \u00f7 112713.07. \n\nAlternatively, use calculator steps. Let me try to do this division more accurately. \n\nLet me note that 112713.07 \u00d7 5 = 563565.35  \nSubtract that from 672394.01: 672394.01 - 563565.35 = 108828.66  \nNow, 112713.07 \u00d7 0.96 = 112713.07 \u00d7 0.9 + 112713.07 \u00d7 0.06  \n= 101441.763 + 6762.7842 = 108204.5472  \nSo, 0.96 \u00d7 112713.07 \u2248 108204.55  \nSubtract that from 108828.66: 108828.66 - 108204.55 = 624.11  \nSo, now, we have 5.96 + (624.11 / 112713.07)  \n624.11 / 112713.07 \u2248 0.00554  \nTherefore, total D/E \u2248 5.96 + 0.00554 \u2248 5.9655, which is approximately 5.97. \n\nNow, the new D/E: 716,504.94 / 112,713.07. Let me do similar steps. \n\nFirst, 112,713.07 \u00d7 6 = 676,278.42  \nSubtract that from 716,504.94: 716,504.94 - 676,278.42 = 40,226.52  \nNow, 40,226.52 / 112,713.07 \u2248 0.357 (as before)  \nSo total D/E \u2248 6 + 0.357 = 6.357, which is approximately 6.36. \n\nTherefore, the ratio increases from ~5.97 to ~6.36. \n\nTherefore, the Debt-to-Equity ratio increases. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the exact decimal values. \n\nLet me compute 672,394.01 / 112,713.07. \n\nLet me use cross multiplication. Let me consider that 112,713.07 \u00d7 5.97 = ?\n\nFirst, 112,713.07 \u00d7 5 = 563,565.35  \n112,713.07 \u00d7 0.97 = 112,713.07 \u00d7 1 - 112,713.07 \u00d7 0.03 = 112,713.07 - 3,381.3921 = 109,331.6779  \nSo total 5.97 \u00d7 112,713.07 = 563,565.35 + 109,331.6779 = 672,897.0279. \n\nBut original total liabilities are 672,394.01, which is less than 672,897.0279. Therefore, the exact D/E ratio is slightly less than 5.97. Let me compute the exact difference. \n\n672,897.0279 - 672,394.01 = 503.0179. \n\nSo, 5.97 - (503.0179 / 112,713.07). \n\n503.0179 / 112,713.07 \u2248 0.00446"

    "qwen_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, Company E needs to maintain a minimum quick ratio of 2.04. They have some current assets, inventories, prepaid expenses, and current liabilities. The question is asking how much additional cash or marketable securities they need to meet this requirement. Alright, let me recall what the quick ratio is.\n\nThe quick ratio, also known as the acid-test ratio, measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. The formula for the quick ratio is:\n\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventories - Prepaid Expenses) / Current Liabilities\n\nWait, let me make sure. Because the quick ratio excludes inventories and prepaid expenses because they are not as liquid as cash or marketable securities. So, yes, that's right. So the formula is (Current Assets minus Inventories minus Prepaid Expenses) divided by Current Liabilities.\n\nBut in the problem, they mention that the company must maintain a minimum quick ratio of 2.04. So we need to calculate the current quick ratio first and see if it meets the requirement. If not, we need to find out how much additional cash or marketable securities are needed to bring it up to 2.04.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given numbers:\n\nCurrent Assets = $344,254\n\nInventories = $36,062\n\nPrepaid Expenses = $23,295\n\nCurrent Liabilities = $208,848\n\nSo, let me compute the current quick ratio. Let me do that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the total of inventories and prepaid expenses: that's 36,062 + 23,295. Let me add those two numbers. \n\n36,062 + 23,295. Let's see, 36,000 + 23,000 is 59,000. Then 62 + 295 is 357. So total is 59,000 + 357 = 59,357. Wait, let me check with exact numbers:\n\n36,062 + 23,295:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n2 + 5 = 7\n\n6 + 9 = 15, carry over 1\n\n0 + 2 + 1 = 3\n\n6 + 3 = 9\n\n3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo the sum is 59,357. Yes, that's correct. So inventories plus prepaid expenses is $59,357.\n\nThen, the quick assets would be current assets minus inventories minus prepaid expenses. So:\n\nQuick Assets = Current Assets - Inventories - Prepaid Expenses = 344,254 - 59,357. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, subtract 59,357 from 344,254.\n\nLet me do 344,254 - 59,357. Let me subtract step by step.\n\n344,254 - 50,000 = 294,254\n\nThen subtract 9,357 more: 294,254 - 9,357.\n\n294,254 - 9,000 = 285,254\n\nThen subtract 357: 285,254 - 357 = 284,897\n\nSo Quick Assets = $284,897\n\nWait, let me check with another method to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nAlternatively, 59,357 + 284,897 = 344,254? Let me check:\n\n284,897 + 59,357:\n\n284,897 + 50,000 = 334,897\n\n334,897 + 9,357 = 344,254. Yes, that's correct. So the quick assets are $284,897.\n\nNow, the current liabilities are $208,848.\n\nSo the current quick ratio is 284,897 / 208,848. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, let me divide both numerator and denominator by, maybe, 100 to simplify? Not sure. Alternatively, use calculator steps.\n\nLet me approximate:\n\n208,848 times 1.3 is 208,848 * 1.3 = 271,502.4\n\nBut 284,897 is more than that. Let me compute 208,848 * 1.37?\n\nAlternatively, maybe better to do exact division.\n\nLet me compute 284,897 divided by 208,848.\n\nLet me write it as 284,897 \u00f7 208,848 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me divide numerator and denominator by, say, 1000 to make it easier: 284.897 / 208.848 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute that. Let me do decimal division.\n\nFirst, 208.848 goes into 284.897 once, because 208.848 * 1 = 208.848. Subtract that from 284.897: 284.897 - 208.848 = 76.049.\n\nSo that's 1 + (76.049 / 208.848). Let me compute 76.049 / 208.848.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 100: 0.76049 / 2.08848 \u2248 0.3646.\n\nSo total ratio is approximately 1.3646. So approximately 1.36.\n\nBut the required quick ratio is 2.04. So current quick ratio is about 1.36, which is below 2.04. Therefore, the company needs to increase its quick assets to meet the required ratio.\n\nSo the question is: How much additional cash or marketable securities are needed?\n\nSo, let me denote the required quick ratio as 2.04. Let me denote the additional amount needed as X. So, the new quick assets will be current quick assets plus X, since adding cash or marketable securities increases quick assets.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n\n(Quick Assets + X) / Current Liabilities = 2.04\n\nWe can solve for X.\n\nWe already have Quick Assets = 284,897, Current Liabilities = 208,848.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(284,897 + X) / 208,848 = 2.04\n\nMultiply both sides by 208,848:\n\n284,897 + X = 2.04 * 208,848\n\nCompute 2.04 * 208,848.\n\nLet me compute that. Let me break down 2.04 into 2 + 0.04.\n\nFirst, 2 * 208,848 = 417,696\n\nThen, 0.04 * 208,848 = ?\n\nWell, 0.04 is 4%, so 10% of 208,848 is 20,884.8, so 4% is 20,884.8 * 0.4 = 8,353.92\n\nSo total 2.04 * 208,848 = 417,696 + 8,353.92 = 426,049.92\n\nTherefore, 284,897 + X = 426,049.92\n\nTherefore, X = 426,049.92 - 284,897 = ?\n\nCompute that:\n\n426,049.92 - 284,897. Let me subtract.\n\nFirst, subtract 284,897 from 426,049.92.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n426,049.92\n\n-284,897.00\n\n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n0.92 - 0.00 = 0.92\n\nThen, 49.92 - 897.00? Wait, maybe better to do it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, subtract 284,897 from 426,049.92:\n\nLet me think of 426,049.92 - 284,897.\n\nFirst, subtract 200,000 from 426,049.92: 226,049.92\n\nThen subtract 84,897: 226,049.92 - 84,897.\n\nCompute 226,049.92 - 80,000 = 146,049.92\n\nThen subtract 4,897: 146,049.92 - 4,897 = 141,152.92\n\nSo X = 141,152.92\n\nTherefore, the company needs an additional $141,152.92 in cash or marketable securities.\n\nBut let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, let me verify the 2.04 * 208,848.\n\nAlternatively, compute 208,848 * 2.04.\n\nLet me compute 208,848 * 2 = 417,696. Then 208,848 * 0.04 = 8,353.92. So total is 417,696 + 8,353.92 = 426,049.92. Correct.\n\nThen, subtract 284,897 from 426,049.92:\n\n426,049.92 - 284,897 = ?\n\nLet me do 426,049.92 - 284,897:\n\nFirst, 426,049.92 - 200,000 = 226,049.92\n\nThen, 226,049.92 - 84,897 = ?\n\n226,049.92 - 80,000 = 146,049.92\n\n146,049.92 - 4,897 = 141,152.92. Yes, same as before. So that's correct.\n\nSo the required additional cash is $141,152.92. But since we're dealing with currency, we usually round to the nearest cent, but in the context of the question, they might expect a whole number. However, the original numbers are all in whole dollars, so maybe we need to check if there's a rounding requirement.\n\nWait, the problem says \"how much additional cash or marketable securities are needed to meet this requirement\". So it's possible that they expect an exact figure, which could be in dollars and cents, but maybe we can present it as a decimal or round to the nearest dollar.\n\nBut let me check if my initial calculation of quick assets was correct. Let me recheck:\n\nCurrent Assets: 344,254\n\nInventories: 36,062\n\nPrepaid Expenses: 23,295\n\nSo, subtracting inventories and prepaid expenses from current assets:\n\n344,254 - 36,062 - 23,295.\n\nLet me compute 344,254 - 36,062 first:\n\n344,254 - 36,062 = 308,192\n\nThen subtract 23,295: 308,192 - 23,295 = ?\n\n308,192 - 20,000 = 288,192\n\n288,192 - 3,295 = 284,897. Yes, same as before. So that's correct.\n\nSo the quick assets are indeed $284,897. So that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the required additional amount is $141,152.92. But let me check if the question requires any specific rounding. The problem doesn't specify, so maybe present it as is, or round to the nearest dollar.\n\nBut in financial terms, sometimes they use cents, but since the original numbers are in whole dollars, maybe they expect a whole number. However, since the calculation resulted in a decimal, perhaps we need to present it as $141,152.92. But let me check if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula? Let me confirm the quick ratio formula again.\n\nYes, the quick ratio is (Current Assets - Inventories - Prepaid Expenses) / Current Liabilities. So that's correct. So the calculation is right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering prepaid expenses as part of current assets, but in the quick ratio, we exclude inventories and prepaid expenses? Wait, actually, prepaid expenses are considered as current assets, but they are not as liquid as cash or marketable securities. Therefore, they are excluded from the quick ratio. So yes, the formula is correct.\n\nSo, the answer is $141,152.92. But let me check if there's any other consideration. For example, is the company allowed to use cash or marketable securities, which are part of the quick assets? So adding cash or marketable securities would increase the numerator, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct.\n\nBut let me check once more:\n\nRequired Quick Ratio = 2.04\n\nCurrent Quick Ratio = 284,897 / 208,848 \u2248 1.3646\n\nSo, the difference is 2.04 - 1.3646 \u2248 0.6754.\n\nSo, the amount needed is 0.6754 * Current Liabilities?\n\nWait, no, that's not the way. Because the required quick ratio is (Quick Assets + X)/Current Liabilities = 2.04. So solving for X gives X = 2.04 * Current Liabilities - Quick Assets.\n\nWhich is exactly what I did. So 2.04 * 208,848 - 284,897 = 426,049.92 - 284,897 = 141,152.92.\n\nYes, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $141,152.92. Depending on the context, maybe they want it rounded to the nearest dollar, so $141,153. But let me check if the numbers in the question are exact. The original numbers are all whole numbers, so perhaps the answer is expected to be a whole number. However, since the calculation results in a decimal, maybe we need to present it as is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of 2.04 * 208,848. Let me verify that with another method.\n\nLet me compute 208,848 * 2.04:\n\nFirst, 208,848 * 2 = 417,696.\n\nThen, 208,848 * 0.04 = ?\n\nWell, 208,848 * 0.04:\n\nMultiply 208,848 by 0.04:\n\n208,848 * 0.04 = 8,353.92. Correct.\n\nSo total is 417,696 + 8,353.92 = 426,049.92. Correct.\n\nThen, subtract 284,897 from that:\n\n426,049.92 - 284,897 = 141,152.92. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, that's the answer.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to think about it. For example, maybe the question considers that inventories and prepaid expenses are not part of the quick assets, but maybe there's another component? No, the standard formula is (Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities. However, in this case, the problem gives current assets, which includes cash, accounts receivable, inventories, and prepaid expenses. Therefore, the quick assets would be current assets minus inventories and prepaid expenses. So, if the company has other components in current assets, like accounts receivable, they are included in the quick assets. So, the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is $141,152.92. However, since the question might expect a specific format, maybe in dollars and cents, or rounded to the nearest dollar. But since the original numbers are in whole dollars, but the calculation gives a decimal, I think it's safe to present it as is. However, in some cases, companies might need to round up to ensure the ratio is met, so maybe $141,153. But the exact answer is $141,152.92.\n\nBut let me check once again if I did the math correctly. Let me use another approach:\n\nLet me compute the required quick assets:\n\nRequired Quick Assets = Required Quick Ratio * Current Li"
